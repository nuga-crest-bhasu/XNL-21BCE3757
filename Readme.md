This repository contains a prototype for the Extreme End-to-End FinTech LLM System, developed for the XNL LLM Task 1 challenge (March 14, 2025). Itâ€™s an AI-powered, risk-aware financial platform integrating LLMs, real-time market data, and autonomous trading. Built in 24 hours, this MVP prioritizes Phases 1 and 2, with stubs for further expansion, targeting low-latency execution, scalability, and compliance readiness.
